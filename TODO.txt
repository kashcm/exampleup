1. Verify repo exists and has docker-compose file (later)
2. Extract docker-compose port (fake for now)s
3. Save deployment (set editor and proxy ports based on #2)
4. Save service (get nodePorts from response)
5. Get node IP address of deployment (#3) - api/pods/ - need to get domain name for node??
